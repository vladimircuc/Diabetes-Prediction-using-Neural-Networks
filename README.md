  <p align="center">
This project developed neural network models using PyTorch and Keras to predict diabetes from a Kaggle dataset. Trained on 2,460 instances and tested on 308, the models used health indicators like glucose, BMI, and insulin to provide binary predictions of diabetes presence. A comprehensive review of the code and prediction results can be found in the PDF attached to this repository.  </p>
